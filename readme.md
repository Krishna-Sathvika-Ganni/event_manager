### CURL COMMAND AND EXAMPLE VALUE NICKNAME: 

Addressed a confusing inconsistency in the Swagger documentation where the nickname field in the cURL request and example response did not match.

- The nickname provided in the cURL request and the example response did not match the API description. 

- This discrepancy was fixed to increase the clarity of the documentation and avoid user confusion.
